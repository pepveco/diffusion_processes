# LÃ©vy Flights (MATLAB)

This folder contains MATLAB scripts to simulate **LÃ©vy flights** in 1D and 2D, analyze heavy-tailed Î±-stable distributions, and compare variance growth for different stability indices Î±.  
The codes illustrate the anomalous nature of LÃ©vy processes compared to Gaussian (Brownian) diffusion.

##Contents

### 1. Distribution
- **`plot_alpha_stable_Levy_distribution.m`**  
  Plots the **PDFs** of symmetric Î±-stable distributions for different values of Î± (Gaussian, Cauchy, heavy-tailed).  
  - Î± = 2 â†’ Gaussian  
  - Î± = 1 â†’ Cauchy  
  - Î± = 0.5 â†’ very heavy-tailed LÃ©vy distribution

### 2. 1D LÃ©vy Flights
- **`Levy_randomwalks_1D_alvariaredi_alpha.m`**  
  Simulates 1D LÃ©vy flights for Î± = 2 (Gaussian), Î± = 1 (Cauchy), and intermediate heavy-tailed Î± values.  
  - Trajectories display rare, large displacements when Î±<2.  

---

### 3. 2D LÃ©vy Flights
- **`2D_LEVY_randomwalk_fixing_alpham.m`**  
  Generates a 2D LÃ©vy flight trajectory (X(t), Y(t)) for Î±=1.2.  
  - Independent Î±-stable increments in x and y.  
  - For Î±=2 this reduces to 2D Brownian motion.

### 4. Variance Growth
- **`divergence_std_vs_time_ANOMALOUS.m`**  
  Computes the empirical standard deviation over time for LÃ©vy flights with different Î±.  
  - Î±=2 (Gaussian): std âˆ¼ âˆšt.  
  - Î±<2: variance is infinite, so the empirical std diverges and fluctuates.  
  - Logâ€“log scale highlights anomalous vs Gaussian scaling.

## ðŸ“– Physics Background

- **Stable distributions:**  
  Defined by (Î±, Î², c, Î¼). Here Î²=0 (symmetric), Î¼=0, c=1.  
  - Î±=2 â†’ Gaussian  
  - Î±=1 â†’ Cauchy  
  - Î±<2 â†’ heavy-tailed LÃ©vy stable law (infinite variance)  

- **LÃ©vy flights:**  
  Constructed as  
  \[
  X_n = \sum_{i=1}^n \xi_i, \quad \xi_i \sim S_\alpha(0,1,0).
  \]  
  They produce jumps of arbitrary size in a single step â†’ **infinite velocity**.  

- **Scaling:**  
  For Î±=2 â†’ diffusive, Ïƒ(t) ~ âˆšt.  
  For Î±<2 â†’ anomalous diffusion: MSD diverges, scaling described by quantiles or distribution tails.

## Notes

- These scripts implement **LÃ©vy flights** (instantaneous Î±-stable jumps).  
- They do **not** implement LÃ©vy walks:  
  - **Flight:** jumps are instantaneous, velocity is unbounded.  
  - **Walk:** jump length and travel time are coupled, ensuring finite velocity.  
- For Î±<2, the **true variance diverges**: the empirical std is only illustrative.  
- **All detailed derivations, plots, and theoretical discussion are presented in the thesis.**
